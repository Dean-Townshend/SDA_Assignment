User Manual

The application consists of three major sections, a grid of sample pads, a dynamic pad controls section and a set of master audio controls.

The Sample Pad Grid - The sample pad grid consists of a grid of buttons that when pressed, change the controls section to reflect the controls of that sample pad. The default selected sample pad is “C4”.

The Controls Section - The file manager at the bottom of the pad controls section is where the user selects the audio file that will be used by the selected sample pad. The Sample Player supports both WAV and AIFF. The controls section also includes a waveform visual of the audio file used by the selected pad. The start and end position sliders control which section of the audio file is played. The positions of the start and end locators are displayed as colour coded vertical lines overlaid on the waveform visual. The pitch control rotary allows the audio file being played to be pitched up or down. The level at which the audio file is played is controlled via the gain rotary. The trigger button allows the sample pad to be trigger manually.

The Master Controls Section - The master controls section of the user interface includes controls for the master reverb wet/dry and room size, as well as a master level control which controls the level of the overall application.

Control Via MIDI Controller - Once a pad or multiple pads have been set up, they can then be triggered by a MIDI controller, to do this, select File>Audio Settings and select a MIDI input. The sample pads can now be triggered by the corresponding notes on the MIDI controller.
